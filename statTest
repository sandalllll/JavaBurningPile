This is the story of a man named Stanley.
Stanley worked for a company in a big building where he was Employee Number 427.
Employee Number 427's job was simple.
He sat at his desk in Room 427, and he pushed buttons on a keyboard.
Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk
telling him what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order.
This is what Employee 427 did every day of every month of every year.
And although others might have considered it soul-rending
Stanley relished every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly for this job.
And Stanley was happy.
